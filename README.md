## 1. Introduction  
**Project Title:**  
HSTU Digital Fundraising System: Supporting Needy Students  

**Project Objective:**  
The primary goal is to create a digital platform that bridges the gap between donors and needy students at HSTU. The system will enable transparent, efficient, and secure financial assistance while fostering accountability and trust among stakeholders.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Streamlined donation processes.  
- Secure and traceable fund transactions.  
- Transparency in fund allocation and usage.  

**Stakeholders:**  
1. **Needy Students:** Students seeking financial aid for education and personal expenses.  
2. **Donors:** Alumni, philanthropic individuals, and organizations willing to contribute.  
3. **University Authorities:** Responsible for verifying students and monitoring fund distribution.

## 2. Agile SDLC Approach  

**Why Agile?**  
Agile is chosen for its flexibility, iterative development cycles, and focus on user feedback. Since donor and student needs may evolve during the project, Agile ensures adaptability while maintaining high product quality.  

**Core Agile Principles Applied:**  
- **Iterative Development:** Breaking the project into manageable sprints.  
- **Collaboration:** Regular involvement of donors, students, and university staff.  
- **Continuous Feedback:** Incorporating suggestions from all stakeholders.  
- **Working Software:** Delivering a functional prototype at the end of each sprint.  

---

## 3. Phases of Project Development  

### Phase 1: Concept and Initiation  
- **Activities:**  
  - Conduct stakeholder interviews to identify pain points.  
  - Analyze existing donation and aid workflows at HSTU.  
  - Define project goals, scope, and high-level requirements.  
- **Output Deliverables:**  
  - Project charter and vision document.  
  - Stakeholder requirement document.  

---

### Phase 2: Planning  
- **Activities:**  
  - Define user personas (donors, students, administrators).  
  - Prepare user stories for essential features:  
    - **Donor registration and profile management.**  
    - **Student application submission and verification.**  
    - **Donation tracking and reporting.**  
  - Develop a project backlog with prioritized tasks.  
  - Create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope, including core features like:  
    - Secure payment gateway.  
    - Student profile management.  
    - Fund allocation transparency dashboard.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Agile boards (e.g., Trello, Jira).  
  - Wireframing tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD).  
- **Output Deliverables:**  
  - Project roadmap and sprint schedule.  
  - Backlog and feature prioritization.

### Phase 3: Iterative Development (Sprints)  
Development follows an iterative process, ensuring functionality is added incrementally. Each sprint includes planning, coding, testing, and review.  

| **Sprint** | **Duration** | **Key Activities** | **Expected Deliverables** |  
|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|  
| Sprint 1   | 2 Weeks      | User registration (donors, students), profile management. | Functional user management module. |  
| Sprint 2   | 3 Weeks      | Implement secure payment gateway and donation tracking. | Donation processing system. |  
| Sprint 3   | 2 Weeks      | Student application portal and verification system. | Functional application workflow. |  
| Sprint 4   | 3 Weeks      | Fund allocation dashboard, notification system. | End-to-end integrated system. |  
| Sprint 5   | 2 Weeks      | UI/UX optimization and accessibility improvements. | Mobile-friendly platform. |  

---

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance  
- **Testing Techniques:**  
  - **Unit Testing:** Validate individual modules like donor registration and fund allocation.  
  - **Integration Testing:** Ensure seamless interaction between components.  
  - **Usability Testing:** Invite a focus group of users to assess the systemâ€™s intuitiveness.  
  - **Security Testing:** Perform penetration tests on payment gateway and user data handling.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Selenium (automation testing).  
  - OWASP ZAP (security testing).  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Bug reports and resolution logs.  
  - Finalized test cases.  

---

### Phase 5: Deployment  
- **Activities:**  
  - Deploy the system on a reliable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
  - Perform load testing to ensure scalability.  
  - Configure system backups and disaster recovery mechanisms.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Fully operational digital fundraising platform.  
  - Deployment and installation guides.  

---

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Continuous Improvement  
- **Activities:**  
  - Set up a feedback loop through surveys and reports from users.  
  - Regularly update the platform with new features based on user requests.  
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Regular performance reports.  
  - Feature updates log.
