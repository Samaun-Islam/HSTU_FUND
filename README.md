## Introduction  
Supporting students who face financial challenges is crucial for fostering an inclusive academic environment. The **HSTU Digital Fundraising System** provides a seamless and user-friendly platform to connect donors with students in need. It aims to simplify fundraising while ensuring trust, transparency, and accountability. By leveraging secure payment systems, role-based access, and real-time updates, this system ensures that donations are impactful and well-managed.

## SDLC Model: Agile Model  

### Why Agile?  
The Agile SDLC model was chosen for its adaptability and focus on user collaboration. Agile enables:  
1. **Iterative Development:** Delivering features incrementally ensures quick user feedback and adjustments.  
2. **User-Centric Design:** Direct engagement with stakeholders guarantees the platform meets real-world needs.  
3. **Transparency:** Regular reviews ensure that all development is visible to the team and stakeholders.  

---

## Project Vision and Planning  
The **HSTU Digital Fundraising System** was planned with the following goals:  
1. Provide a secure platform for collecting and managing donations.  
2. Enable students to apply for financial assistance transparently.  
3. Equip administrators with tools for campaign management and verification.  

Key planning phases included:  
1. Requirement gathering from students, donors, and administrators.  
2. Designing wireframes and system architecture.  
3. Setting up an Agile roadmap with sprints for incremental development.

## User Requirements and System Requirements  

### User Requirements  
1. **Donors:**  
   - Secure donation process with transaction history.  
   - Real-time updates on campaign progress.  
2. **Beneficiaries:**  
   - Application for financial aid with document upload.  
   - Status tracking of applications.  
3. **Administrators:**  
   - Verification of beneficiaries.  
   - Campaign creation and fund allocation reports.  

### System Requirements  
1. **Frontend:** Responsive user interface for web and mobile devices.  
2. **Backend:** Secure server handling authentication, data storage, and transactions.  
3. **Database:** Store user information, campaign details, and transaction logs.  
4. **Payment Gateway:** Integration with secure APIs like Stripe.  
5. **Notifications:** Real-time alerts for donors and beneficiaries.

## Design and Architecture  

- **Frontend:** Built using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.  
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js for scalable and efficient server-side operations.  
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing campaign and user data.  
- **Security:** Implemented using HTTPS, JWT for authentication, and encryption for sensitive data.  

---

## Development (Iterations/Sprints)  

### Sprint Breakdown  
1. **Sprint 1:** Requirement gathering, wireframing, and project setup.  
2. **Sprint 2:** User authentication and role-based access implementation.  
3. **Sprint 3:** Campaign creation and application process.  
4. **Sprint 4:** Payment gateway integration and transaction tracking.  
5. **Sprint 5:** UI refinement, bug fixes, and deployment preparation.
